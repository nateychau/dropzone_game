Background
Dropzone is a game where players direct a falling watermelon to a goal by drawing lines to control the direction that the watermelon falls in. There are jewels scattered around each level, and players can get bonus points by creating a path that directs the watermelon to these jewels along it's way to the goal.

Potential future features:

- Trampolines for players to add along the path
- Obstacles 
- Build your own level
